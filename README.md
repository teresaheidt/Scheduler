# How the daily calendar works
When the user is in the daily calendar, the current day is displayed, which is the day, the time and what time zone the user is in. The user can scroll to the specific time block they want, to schedule their event and then type within that timebox. After clicking the lock button on the far right side, the event will then be stored in local storage. After refreshing the page, the saved events will persist. 
# Functionality
This is a dynamic work day calendar, which shows you color coded time blocks to make it easy to navigate the tasks set for that day. The program used bootstrap, making the style of the calendar clean and easy to read.
