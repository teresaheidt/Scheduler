# How the daily calendar work
When the user is in the daily calendar, the current day is displayed, which is the day, the time and what time zone the user is in. The user can scroll to the specific time block they want, to schedule their event and then type within that timebox. After clicking the save button on the far right side, the event will then be stored in local storage. After refreshing the page, the saved events will persist. 
# Functionality
